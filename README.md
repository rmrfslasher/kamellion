# Kamellion

The framework for this project's code is from the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/quicknote">QuickNote</a> extension example by Mozilla.

This project *currently* allows you to convert non-British English text into British English text.

**Samples:**

  - color -> colour
  
  - cracker -> biscuit
  
  - checkers -> draughts
  
  
Later additions will support more colloquialisms and a reverse of the above.

I have attempted to list generic terms, but there may be one off cases where it might produce bad syntax.

**So why use this?**

Well, anti-textual analysis may be needed for some :^)
